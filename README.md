# Pawan Joshi | Interactive Portfolio

An interactive, developer-focused personal portfolio designed to look and feel like a mini desktop operating system, complete with draggable windows and a functional terminal.

## 🚀 About This Project

This isn't your average portfolio. Built from scratch with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project reimagines how a developer's profile can be presented. Instead of a static page, users can interact with a desktop environment, open applications (windows), and even use a command-line interface to learn about me and my work.

The goal was to create a unique and memorable experience that showcases not only my projects and skills but also my creativity and passion for development.

## ✨ Features

- 🖥️ **OS-Inspired UI**: A clean, retro desktop interface that's responsive and works seamlessly on both mobile and PC
- 🪟 **Interactive Windows**: Each section (About, Projects, Skills, Education) opens in its own draggable and resizable window
- 👨‍💻 **Functional Terminal**: A built-in terminal with custom commands to navigate the portfolio. Try typing `help` or `neofetch`!
- 📱 **Fully Responsive**: The layout adapts smoothly to any screen size, providing a great experience on any device
- ⚡ **Lightweight & Fast**: No heavy frameworks, just pure HTML, CSS, and JS for optimal performance
